	<h2>Autobiography</h2>
	<p>Hello! I'm Emmet Hayes, a software engineer and recent Computer Science master's graduate from Tufts University. With a deep passion for interactivity and data, I've spent over two years in the software industry, specializing in audio technology. My journey includes refining build tools and installers for a major line of audio effects plug-ins and transforming C++ GUIs for better usability. My expertise extends to crafting optimized Python scripts, tackling complex bugs, and exploring the frontiers of AI in audio, particularly its potential in creative automation. In my commitment to open-source development and knowledge sharing, I've created HayesPlugins, a free bundle of audio plug-ins showcasing my skills and learnings. Explore my work, available here: <a href="https://github.com/Emmet-Hayes">GitHub</a></p>
	<p>While pursuing my degree, I found that I'm deeply interested in the possibilities presented by the use of AI, specifically with audio. With large language models making huge waves in multiple industries, there are naturally some use-cases that will likely cause a paradigm shift in the audio software field, and will allow creative automation to take place on a level not yet seen before. I am excited to witness the future and to make an impact in my field.</p>
