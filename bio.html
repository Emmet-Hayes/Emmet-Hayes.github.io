	<p>Autobiography</p>
	<p>Hi! My name is Emmet Hayes and I'm a software engineer with a serious passion for interactivity and data. I've worked for 2 years in the software industry, and am now currently finishing my masters in Computer Science full-time at Tufts University. Previously I have worked on improving and maintaining the build tools and installers for a large product line of audio effects plug-ins, refactored statically-sized C++ GUIs to be resizable, developed highly-optimized python scripts utilizing computer vision and input validation. finished difficult tackled long-standing bugs in codebases, worked on refactoring making their GUIs fully resizable, and have learned much from my experiences along the way. I have also created my own bundle of audio plug-ins using what I have learned so far, which is free and open-source, available here <a href="https://github.com/Emmet-Hayes/HayesPlugins">HayesPlugins</a></p>
	<p>While pursuing my degree, I'm found that I'm very interested in the possibilities presented by the use of AI, specifically with audio. With large language models making huge waves in multiple industries, there are naturally some use-cases like text-to-speech and eventually text-to-music that will likely cause a paradigm shift in the audio software field, and will allow creative automation to take place on a level not yet seen before.</p>
