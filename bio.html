	<p>Autobiography</p>
	<p>Hi! My name is Emmet and I am a software engineer with a serious passion for interactivity and data. I've worked for 2 years in the software industry, and now I'm currently pursuing my masters in Computer Science full-time. Previously I have worked on improving and maintaining the build tools and installers for a large product line of audio effects plug-ins, refactored statically-sized C++ GUIs to be resizable, developed highly-optimized python scripts utilizing computer vision and input validation. finished difficult tackled long-standing bugs in codebases, 
	worked on refactoring dynamic resizing of statically-sized GUIs, and learned much from my experiences along the way :).</p>
	<p>While pursuing my degree, I'm found that I'm very interested in the possibilities with web audio. In the music recording industry, the industry standard method typically is to use a standalone application as the main platform to record, make, and edit music. My belief is that there is a lack of robust web-based options for music creatives on the market, and that there will be eventually be a point when the market will shift towards preferring web-based options. Here are some pros and cons to consider:</p>

		<tr>
			<th>Pros</th>
			<th>Cons</th>
		<tr>
			<th>More lightweight, users don't have to download software locally</th>
			<th>Difficult implementation details to consider</th>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<th>More accessible, anyone with a browser can use the web</th>
			<th>Cannot guarantee performance will be feasible on all devices</th>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<th>Better storage options, depending on how its implemented, it could have a back end that can support paid users to host their files on servers, or let users utilize their local storage.</th>
