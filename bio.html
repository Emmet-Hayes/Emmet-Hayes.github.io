	<p>Hi! I am a software engineer with a serious passion for interactivity and data. I currently live in Brooklyn where I live with my two friends Ally and Alec. When I'm not coding, you'll find me making or producing music, attempting some cooking or baking recipe, riding a bicycle, taking a walk, or going to a live event.</p>
